 * Resolves the set of valid input / output port ids for a node, so
 * {@see FlowAuthoring::connect()} can reject an edge that references a port the
 * node does not have — a check {@see \FancyFlow\Workflow::import()} does NOT
 * perform (it validates edge endpoints exist, not that handles are real ports).
 *
 * The base set comes straight from the kind's declared ports:
 *   - `outputs`/`inputs` === null  → the engine default single `out` / `in` port
 *   - declared list                → those ids
 *   - declared empty `[]`          → an explicit terminal (no ports)
 *
 * A few kinds compute their ports from config at runtime (mirroring the TS
 * `outputs: (config) => …` closures). For those this resolver augments the base
 * set by reading config THE SAME WAY the executors document — never by calling
 * fancy-flow-php. It is deliberately generous: whole-graph correctness is still
 * owned by `validate_workflow` (which runs `Workflow::import`).
