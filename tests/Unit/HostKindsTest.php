/**
 * The authoring catalogue must include the HOST's kinds, not only ours.
 *
 * `FlowAuthoring::default()` built a registry of builtins alone, so an agent
 * authoring through this server could not see — or connect to — any kind the
 * host application had registered. For a host whose workflows are mostly built
 * from its own kinds, that is the difference between an MCP that can author its
 * real graphs and one that can only author ours.
 *
 * Why it matters more than "some kinds are missing": `connect_nodes` validates
 * source and target ports against the kind. An edge naming a source port
 * nothing publishes does NOT fail and does NOT warn —
 * `FlowRunner::collectInputs` binds a payload only when
 * `"<sourceId>:<handle>"` exists, so the edge silently delivers nothing. The
 * downstream template is then completely correct and renders empty, because the
 * payload never arrived to have a field in it.
 *
 * A consumer misdiagnosed two filed issues off the back of exactly that, and an
 * agent "fixed" one by correcting a field name that was never wrong. Authoring
 * through an API that knows the ports removes the string there is to get wrong
 * — but only for kinds the API can see.
